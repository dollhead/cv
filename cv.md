features because of great integration with a Windows Management Instrumentation

### Projects
- June 2015 - April 2018 **Rapid Recovery on-premise backup solution**
Our team designed and released a feature for backing up virtualized environments such as Hyper-V and VMware ESXi. As a member of the team, I was involved in designing, implementing, documenting solutions and proposing ideas for new features. During this period of my career, I improved my skills in searching hidden implementation details when integrating with Hyper-V and vSphere API.

- April 2018 - August 2018 **Rapid Recovery SaaS Solutions**
Our team was implementing a cloud-based administrator portal for managing Rapid Recovery on-premise backup solutions. I worked with cutting-edge technologies and architectural approaches e.g. microservice architecture, Azure Service Fabric, Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage. My main responsibility was integration with on-premise solutions, improving the reliability of communication with cloud-based solutions and mentoring newcomers(i.e. making code review, guiding them through project architecture and involved technologies).

- August 2018 - November 2018 **Quest Continuous Data Protection Project**
I was part of the team which was designing and implementing a prototype for a self-managed backup service. I designed and implemented a process of communication with cloud management portal and a CLI for managing service.

- January 2019 - July 2019 **YouControl** Our team designed and implemented solutions for scrapping,
normalizing and interconnecting data from multiple open sources. Therefore, our users enjoyed the
ability to check different aspects of state of their contractors. As a part of the team, I was responsible
for designing our Web API, supporting our web-messenger bots, scrapping and normalizing large
amounts of data.

- August 2019 - November 2019 **Advisor360** I was working on a project, main goal of which is to connect financial advisors with their customers to maximize incomes from their investments. As a part of a team, I am responsible for the process of product transition from single to multiple clients.

- November 2019 - till now **PublicNow** 




### Hobbies and pet-projects
On my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of data science and data visualization. I am the author of [Kyiv Buildings History project](http://dollhead.github.io/) which visualizes years of Kyiv residential buildings construction. Also, I enjoy exploring different datasets using python and pandas, trying to find interesting data stories.
Besides that, my hobbies are reading, playing guitar, road cycling, intellectual games, football, and traveling.
